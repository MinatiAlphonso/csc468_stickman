        </p>
        <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
        <p>
            1. The background of a page must include a color other than white or a background image.<br>
            This can be found in the following files: mainStyle.css, fileStyle.css, helpStyle.css.<br> 
            I used the same background for all three pages.<br> 
            You can find the style under 'body'.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            2. There must be a custom CSS header included in all pages (note, not heading).<br>
            This can be found in the following files: mainStyle.css, fileStyle.css, helpStyle.css.<br> 
            I used the same header for all three pages. <br>
            You can fund the style under 'header'.<br><br> 
        </p>    
        <p>
            3. The CSS on the navigation bar must include a background color/image rule.<br>
            This can be found in the following files: mainStyle.css, fileStyle.css, helpStyle.css. <br>
            I used the same navigation bar for all three pages, it has three options: Main, File, and Help.<br>
            You can find the style under 'nav', '.navitem', and 'a:link, a:visited'.<br>  
        </p>    
        <p>
            4. There must be a custom link ('a') rule.<br>
            This can be found in the following files: mainStyle.css, fileStyle.css, helpStyle.css.<br>
            I used it mainly for the three options - Main, File, and Help.<br>
            You can find the style under 'a:link, a:visited'. In helpStyle.css only, there is another style <br>
            found under 'a:link.help, a:visited.help' for the links to the different sections of the 'Help' page.<br><br>
        </p>    
        <p>
            5. There may not be notable gaps between the stickman images.<br>
            This can be found in mainStyle.css, under 'div'.<br><br>
        </p>    
        <p>
            6. The stickman area must include a border of some sort.<br>
            This can be found in mainStyle.css under '.canvas'. <br><br>
        </p>    
        <p>
            7. The help page headings must have a font style change<br>
            This can be found in Help.css under 'h2'.<br><br>
        </p>
